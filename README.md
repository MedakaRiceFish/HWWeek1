## Business Activities:  

<br>

#### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
* Tala is attempting to bring credit worthiness to those not already part of the tradition financial systems. She says she *"...started to realize that one of the major problems was how do we get someone from the microfinance system into the formal credit system? How do we get them access?"* [[2]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2016/08/29/how-tala-mobile-is-using-phone-data-to-revolutionize-microfinance/?sh=df702232a9f2)

#### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
* Tala's intended customers are individuals who do not currently fall into the traditional financial systems around the world, either those who are "unbanked" or have no previous credit history and no ability to start anew in the traditional system. 

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* They provide a method for people who have access to a smartphone to gain credit. They do so by allowing the company to utilize data from that smartphone to analyze their habits, patterns, and networks to determine creditworthiness and identity. [[2]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2016/08/29/how-tala-mobile-is-using-phone-data-to-revolutionize-microfinance/?sh=df702232a9f2) 

#### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

* Currently, the company utilizes machine learning algorithms and smarthphone data to build a credit score. "By analyzing user’s social network, app and email usage, location over time and personal contacts, Tala’s algorithm is able to correlate user’s behavior with its credit worthiness. For example, the algorithm identified that users that have high network diversity and constant contact with that network have a 9% increase in repayment rates" [[3]](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/tala-providing-loans-for-those-without-a-financial-identity/)[[4]](https://www.ted.com/talks/shivani_siroya_a_smart_loan_for_people_with_no_credit_history_yet)

## Landscape:

#### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* Tala is in the underbanked sector of the Fintech industry. [[5]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp#fintech-landscape)

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* Collectively some of the largest trends we've seen in the loan/credit industries (including the "unbanked") has been a shift away from the traditional credit systems to social credit and non-traditional data sources. One good example is how new companies are challenging traditional FICO scores, which use an algorithm *"very similar formula to when it was first used back in 1989"* [[6]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/05/08/beyond-credit-scores-how-fintech-companies-are-leveraging-tech-to-see-a-bigger-picture/?sh=250539343131) These companies, such as Blend, Blockfi, Avant, utilize a bigger picture scenario and utilize machine learning to absorb the data to spit out a more difinitive picture of the entire individual. 

#### What are the other major companies in this domain?

* There's quite a few, but some notable names include Sofi, Affirm, Klarna, Avant, Borro, Fundera, Funding Circle, Kabbage, Lending club, to name a few. [[7]](https://empirica-software.com/fintech-companies-lending/)

## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* *"Tala has disbursed over $1B in credit to more than 4 million customers who use Tala loans to start and expand small businesses, pay school fees and bills, and build more stable financial lives."* [[1]](https://tala.co/faq/) 

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* In lending, the default rate is one of the most importmant metrics as it measures the risk a company faces when lending to it's audience. Too much risk and a company will never be able to recover it's funds and be profitable. Tala serves the sup-prime lending audience. In the US sub-prime loands have a default rate of 16.5% [3]() while Tala has a default rate of 8% [3], meaning that Tala has succeeded in serving the same market with almost half the default rate. 

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

* This is a diffucult question to compare as many of the competing lending firms within fintech are loaning to more of the traditional sector, and one of Tala's competitive advantages is loaning to the non-traditional sector customers. For example, This [[8]](https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/ratings/research/11487802.pdf) research by S&P global suggets thats SoFi has a default rate of less than 4%, which would pale Tala's rate. But considering the markets they serve, it's best to compare Tala's rate to the Sub-prime loan rates instead.

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

* I would highly suggest finding a way in which they could implement blockchain/crypto currency as the end loan currency or back end platform that acts as a debit card granting access to the funds whenever needed.

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* I believe that their current method works well for people who are willing and able to provide basic information, and provide access to app data. However, by collecting and storing/housing that data in one location for their analysis, I believe that they are also creating unecessary risk for their clients. They could utilize blockchain technology to track and analyze the same information but in a more secure methodology using the blockchain. They start by offering the loan funds in digital curency that can be tracked, while offering the ability to pay with that same device. 

#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Public facing blockchain technology would be implemented to track the ways in which the money loaned is spent without needing to get as deep within the individuals device data to gather the info needed for analysis. 
#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* I believe that it would be appropriate because it allows for psuedo-anoniminity of the user while still being able to track and build a data profile on the individual without needing to gather all of their personal data/information in one place.
